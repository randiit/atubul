#I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the
 greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. I have a
 dream that thousands years from now, humanity will wonder why there had to be
 such a struggle for freedom because granting freedom will be such a natural
 right that no will think could be taken away
